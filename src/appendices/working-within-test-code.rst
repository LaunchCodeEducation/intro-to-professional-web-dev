How to Work within Test Code
============================

Intro
-----

1. Test code will be part of your JS assignments
2. Created to validate your code
3. Use this appendix as a point of reference to help you get used to this type of starter code.

First Glance at the Tests
-------------------------

1. when you open your frist assignment, there will be a lot of code already in your replit.  
   
   a. What is it?
   b. Where did it come from?
   c. What do you need to do?
   
      i. we have added comments and notes to help guide you - follow the guidelines and you should be golden

How A Test Works
----------------

2. Here's a Hello World example
   
   a. replit to code along
   b. point out key mechanics and functionaltiy - VERY simple (this is for A1, not the Jasmine chapter)
   c. code blocks and screen shots for things to notice

Practice Test
-------------

3. Sandbox for you to play with

   a. Hello World works, but have them code Hello "NAME" (test that Name is not "")
   b. Make this a step by step thing
      
      i. In line 9, add ... etc. 

4.  You will learn more about testing and creating tests later.
