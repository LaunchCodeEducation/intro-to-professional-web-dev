Welcome LaunchCoder! We're so glad you're here. LaunchCoders help make 
our curriculum stronger. You're a part of this community as a learner 
and we want you to contribute to making our classes stronger.

Questions
---------
Got a question? That's great! Questions mean you're learning. 
Check out our `discourse forum <help.launchcode.org>`__. If you have a 
question about the material, chances are someone else has one too! 
Maybe they've already asked it here and you'll find the help you need. 
Maybe the question hasn't been asked yet. If you don't see an answer, 
make a new post about what you're looking to have answered. Questions 
work best when they are tied to a part of a lesson or assignment - that 
way, fellow community members have an easier time finding the context to 
your queries.
While you're there, if you see any questions you have the answer to, 
help another learner out and answer someone's query.
