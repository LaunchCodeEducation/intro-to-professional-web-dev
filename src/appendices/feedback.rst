Welcome LaunchCoder! We're so glad you're here. LaunchCoders help make 
our curriculum stronger. You're a part of this community as a learner 
and we want you to contribute to making our classes stronger.

Questions
---------

Got a question? That's great! Questions mean you're learning. 
Check out our `discourse forum <help.launchcode.org>`__. 

Use the *Sign Up* button to create an account and get started 
asking questions. Before you do, you'll want to read 
`this helpful post <https://help.launchcode.org/t/how-to-ask-for-help/4756/2>`__
on how to best ask for help. When it comes to technical problems, there is 
such a thing as a bad question. Or at least, a question that does not provide 
enough detail.

If you have a question about the material, chances are someone else has one too! 
Maybe they've already asked it here and you'll find the help you need. 
Maybe the question hasn't been asked yet. If you don't see an answer, 
make a new post about what you're looking to have answered. Questions 
work best when they are tied to a part of a lesson or assignment - that 
way, fellow community members have an easier time finding the context to 
your queries.
While you're there, if you see any questions you have the answer to, 
help another learner out and answer someone's query. 

Updates
-------

Software Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We try our best to keep this book up to date with the technologies 
this book depends on. If the book tells you to use a software
version that is older than the one listed on the site to download, 
don't fret.
There's a convention in software development called 
`semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ that accounts for software projects 
that evolve over time. Basically, software versions are tracked using 
three tiers of updates - major, minor, and patch. Patch updates happen more 
frequently than updates to this book. For the most part, your learning will 
not be affected by these kinds of changes but its wise to make note of this 
for yourself and your classmates if you notice that a solution we provide 
doesn't match your own in the presence of a patch update.
The same can be said of minor updates but it is slightly more likely that 
a minor software update can cause differences in your experience to what is 
described in this book. If that's the case, make note of it and let us know.

Suggested Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you're ready for it, we want to work with you to make the change yourself and 
join us as contributors to this text.

Opening Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're a new learner, you should make an issue on GitHub to describe the 
update as you suggest it.

Use 
`these instructions <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository>`__ 
to get started. Use `this repository <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev>`__ 
when you're ready to open an issue.


Opening Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're more familiar with version control and GitHub specifically, 
we want you to make a pull request with the change you want. It's not your 
fastest option, but once approved, you'll have made a contribution to 
this open-source textbook. That's no small feat.

First, you'll need to `fork the textbook repository <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`__.
Once it's forked, clone the repo onto your computer and follow `our instructions 
here <https://education.launchcode.org/curriculum-docs/building/setup.html>`__ to build the project and make the edits you want to see.
