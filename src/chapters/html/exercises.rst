===============

Complete the HTML file for this simple web page. Add lines to ``index.html`` that do the following.

1. Add a ``h1`` to the page that says "Why I Love Web Development"
2. Add an ordered list to the page with 3 reasons why you love web development.
3. Add a link to this page below your list.

.. replit:: html
   :slug: HTMLExercises
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
         <!-- h1 goes here --->
         <!-- ol goes here --->
         <!-- a goes here --->
         <!-- p goes here --->
      </body>
   </html>

.. note::

   repl.it has other HTML inside of the ``index.html`` file you will be editing.
   You should not be deleting any code only, only adding code to the file!
   
   In addition, when clicking on your link to make sure it works, right-click to open in a new tab!
