Introduction
============

.. index:: ! scope

In the :ref:`Functions chapter <function-scope>`, we saw that *where* variables
are declared and initialized in the code affects when they can be used. This
idea is called **scope**, and it describes the ability of a program to access
or modify a variable.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: js
      :linenos:

      let a = 0;

      function coolFunction() {
         let b = 2;
         return a + b;
      }

   ``a`` is accessible *inside* and *outside* of ``coolFunction()``.

   ``b`` is only accessible *inside* of ``coolFunction()``.

Let's add some ``console.log`` statements to explore this code snippet.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: JavaScript
      :linenos:

      let a = 0;
      console.log(a);

      function coolFunction() {
         let b = 2;
         console.log(`a = ${a}, b = ${b}.`);
         return a + b;
      }

      a += 1;
      console.log(a);

      coolFunction();
      console.log(b);

   **Console Output**

   ::

      0
      1
      a = 1, b = 2.
      ReferenceError: b is not defined

#. Lines 2 and 11 print the initial and incremented values of ``a``.
#. Line 13 calls ``coolFunction()``, and line 6 prints the values of ``a`` and
   ``b``. This shows that both variables are accessible within the function.
#. Line 14 throws a ReferenceError, showing that ``b`` is not accessible
   outside of ``coolFunction``.

Block/Local Scope
-----------------

.. index:: ! local scope

**Local scope** refers to variables declared and initialized inside a function
or block. A *locally scoped* variable can only be referenced inside of the
block or function where it is defined. In the example above, ``b`` has a local
scope limited to ``coolFunction()``. Referencing or attempting to update  ``b``
outside of the function leads to a scoping error.

.. admonition:: Try It!

   The following code block has an error related to scope.
   Try to fix it!

   .. replit:: js
      :slug: ScopeError
      :linenos:

      function myFunction() {
         let i = 10;
         return 10 + i;
      }

      console.log(i);

Global Scope
------------

.. index:: ! global scope

**Global scope** refers to variables declared and initialized outside of a
function and in the main body of the file. These variables are accessible to
any function within a file. In the first example above, ``a`` has global scope.

Global scope is the default in JavaScript. If you assign a value to a variable
WITHOUT first declaring it with ``let`` or ``const``, then the variable
automatically becomes global.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: JavaScript
      :linenos:

      // Code here CAN use newVariable.

      function coolFunction() {
         newVariable = 5;
         return newVariable;
      }

      // Code here CAN use newVariable.

.. admonition:: Warning

   In the loop ``for (i = 0; i < string.length; i++)``, leaving off the
   ``let`` from ``i = 0`` means that ``i`` is treated as a global variable.
   ANY other portion of the program can access or modify ``i``, which could
   disrupt how well the loop operates.

Execution Context
-----------------

.. index:: ! execution context

**Execution context** refers to the conditions under which a variable is
executed---its scope. Scoping affects the variable's behavior at runtime.
When the code is run in the browser, everything is first run at a global
context. As the compiler processes the code and finds a function, it shifts
into the function context before returning to global execution context.

Let's consider this code:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   let a = 0;

   function coolFunction() {
      let b = 2;
      return a + b;
   }

   function coolerFunction() {
      let c = 5;
      c += coolFunction();
      return c;
   }

   console.log(coolFunction());
   console.log(coolerFunction());

Now, let's consider the execution context for each step.

#. First, the global execution context is entered as the compiler executes the
   code.

   .. figure:: figures/globalexecutioncontext.png
      :scale: 80%
      :alt: Figure showing global execution context at the bottom of the stack.

#. Once ``coolFunction()`` is hit, the compiler creates and executes
   ``coolFunction()`` under the ``coolFunction()`` execution context.

   .. figure:: figures/coolFunction.png
      :scale: 80%
      :alt: Figure showing coolFunction on top of global execution context.

#. Upon completion, the compiler returns to the global execution context.

   .. figure:: figures/globalexecutioncontext.png
      :scale: 80%
      :alt: Figure showing global execution context at the bottom of the stack.

#. The compiler stays at the global execution context until the creation and
   execution of ``coolerFunction()``.

   .. figure:: figures/coolerFunction.png
      :scale: 80%
      :alt: Figure showing coolerFunction on top of the global execution context.

#. Inside of ``coolerFunction()`` is a call to ``coolFunction()``. The compiler
   will go up in execution context to ``coolFunction()`` before returning down
   to ``coolerFunction()``'s execution context. Upon completion of that
   function, the compiler returns to the global execution context.

Check Your Understanding
------------------------

Both of the concept checks refer to the following code block:

.. sourcecode:: js
   :linenos:

   function myFunction(n) {
      let a = 100;
      return a + n;
   }

   let x = 0;

   x = myFunction(x);

.. admonition:: Question

   What scope is variable ``x``?

   a. Global
   b. Local

.. admonition:: Question

   In what order will the compiler execute the code?
