`Repl.it with starter code <https://repl.it/@launchcode/Exercises-DOM-and-Events>`__

#. When the *Take off* button is clicked, the text ``The shuttle is on the
   ground`` changes to ``Houston, we have lift off!``. The *Take off* button
   has an ``id="liftoffButton"`` attribute.
#. When the user's mouse goes over the *Abort Mission* button, the button's
   background turns red. The *Abort Mission* button has ``id="abortMission"``.
#. When the user clicks the *Abort Mission* button, make a confirmation window
   that says ``Are you sure you want to abort the mission?``
