The JavaScript Language
=======================

.. index:: JavaScript

**JavaScript** is one of many programming languages, each of which serves
different purposes. Programmers mainly use JavaScript for web development,
and it is currently the most popular language that runs inside a web browser.
*Running inside the browser* means that the code loads at the same time as a
web page and can modify the content. JavaScript can add or remove text, change
colors, produce animations, and react to mouse and keyboard clicks. This makes
the web page *dynamic*---it responds to user actions in real time, and changes
occur without having to refresh the page.

.. index:: ! front end

This cool feature allows immediate updates to your profile when you post a
status, change the color of the “Submit” button after you complete a form,
generate a map when you request directions, or create a sparkly trail that
follows the mouse pointer. All of the changes to what you see on the web page
are part of **front end** development. They are present on your computer.

.. index:: ! Back end

**Back end** development involves passing data between web pages and servers.
JavaScript can be used for back end development, but other languages like Java
and C# are industry standards. When you fill out a form online and click
"Submit", back end code transfers the information you entered to the company
that posted the form. Your information now exists on the company’s servers.

The ins and outs of how the internet works will be covered throughout this
book. While important to understand why we are learning JavaScript, we won’t
quiz you on servers and front end development now!
