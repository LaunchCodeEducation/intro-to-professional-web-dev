Marathon Analogy
----------------

Pretend you are not a runner (complete with the "0.0" sticker on your car),
but you decide to compete in a marathon. You cannot just drive to the
starting line, put on your running shoes and go.

You have to train:

a. Begin by getting good at running 1 mile.
b. Then get good at running 3 miles.
c. Then get good at running 6, then 8, then 10 miles. By now you could try a
   half-marathon, and proudly slap a "13.1" sticker on your car.
d. Continue training and increasing your distance. You WILL earn that "26.2"
   sticker, which will look GREAT when placed in line with 0.0 and 13.1.
e. Your stickers demonstrate your commitment and might even inspire other
   non-runners. They will see how you started "just like them" and notice how
   your effort spurred personal growth.

Learning to code follows the same idea:

a. Begin with "Hello world!"
b. Then learn variables, strings and arrays.
c. Then learn if/else statements and loops, followed by functions and modules.
d. Then code your first "half-marathon".
e. Continue practicing to increase your skills. You WILL earn that
   marathon.js sticker as you build solid demo projects and complete more
   interviews.
f. Welcome, fellow coder. Don't forget to inspire others.
