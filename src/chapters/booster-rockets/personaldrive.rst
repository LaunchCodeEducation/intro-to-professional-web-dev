The Power of Persistence
=================================

.. _personal-drive:

A wise programmer once told me that the reassuring thing about coding is that there is always an answer. She said that while much of life is uncertain and we're faced with questions that don't have definite answers, when we program we can be certain that there is an answer to whatever problem that we have. We just need to find it.

This is where persistence (aka "grit", aka "frustration tolerance") comes in. What characterizes people who succeed as computer programmers is not how much math they know, or whether they took apart computers when they were eleven years old, or even whether they have a computer science degree. It is how hard they will work to find a solution.

What it takes to succeed as you go through this course and beyond in your coding journey is a determination to not give up, to keep trying new things, to keep taking another look at the problem and coming up with another idea for how to solve it, and to accept that this maddening process is not some flaw in you or in the field, but rather that it is the nature of the job itself, and that you can learn to love it. And that's why they'll pay you the big bucks. 

Philosophy & An Appeal to Wisdom

   I do, and I understand.

Experience is definitely the best teacher. You could read pages and pages
about ``for`` loops, which will give you a handle on the vocabulary. However,
until you actually construct your first working loop, your understanding will
be incomplete.


Job Success
-----------

Imagine you land a sweet tech job, and on your first day your boss says to you,
"Implement a recursive algorithm to flatten our data structure." If your entire
prep for this job was reading with very little coding, you might understand
each individual word, but actually accomplishing the task would be a disaster.

Now imagine your prep involved using recursion and constructing algorithms over
and over again. You would not only understand the words, but also have a
strong idea of how to convert those words into working code.


Personal Drive (Grit)
---------------------

Does the following statement resonate with you? If so, perfect.

   "If I stumble, I WILL pick myself up, brush off the dust, and try again."

All throughout LC101, you will be asked to code. Each exercise, studio and
assignment is designed to give you experience through practice. You WILL make
mistakes, and that is OK. Often, our mistakes teach us more than getting the
correct answer on our first try.

Every genius programmer you see on Facebook or YouTube started out in front of
a screen saying, "Oops," "ARGH!" or "#*&%%@#!" No one simply "gets" coding
without some trial-and-error.

Effort = Outcome
-----------------

Let's take a look at a sample coding task: *"Prompt the user to enter a number, then print 'Even' if it is divisible by 2, otherwise print 'Odd'."*

Now let's take a look at an imaginary student's attempt at solving this problem:

::

   1.
   2.
   3.
   4.
   5.

Hmmm. A blank answer space. What might be the reason?

a. The student did not understand how to solve the problem.
b. The student knew how to solve the problem and decided to skip the task.
c. The student tried to solve the problem, could not get the program to work, so deleted the code.
d. The student ran out of time when trying to complete the prep work before class.

From a teacher's perspective, ANY of these reasons could be valid, and we have
no way of determining which is true. This prevents us from knowing how to best
help the student. Where would we begin?

For the student, a blank response provides no benefit because the necessary
practice was either ignored or incomplete. Students gain only as much as they
put in. SO:

a. Even if you have no clue how to approach a task, MAKE AN ATTEMPT ANYWAY, then ask questions.
b. If you know how to solve the problem, COMPLETE THE TASK ANYWAY, because practice makes better. Also, you could use your code to help answer a classmate's question.
c. If you tried to solve the problem, but your code did not work, DO NOT DELETE YOUR ATTEMPT. Ask a question. Showing your work to your teacher, TA or classmates will give them a clear idea about your thought process.
d. If you ran out of time, GO BACK AND FILL IN THE BLANKS LATER. Practice makes better. If you neglect one set of skills, then the tasks that come later and depend on those skills will be more difficult.

.. tip::

   Learning takes work, and you need the practice. *Do your homework*.
