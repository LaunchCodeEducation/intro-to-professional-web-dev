Traits of Good Programmers
--------------------------

**Curious. Good communicator. Creative. Detail-oriented. Persistent. Problem solver.**

These are some traits that successful computer programmers share. People come to computer programming from all different walks of life and previous job experiences. But the things they have in common are that they like to solve problems, they can both imagine (or invent) the "big picture" as well as pay attention to the "little details", they can express their ideas and listen attentively to the ideas of others, and they are persistent--they don't give up!

As you'll soon discover, coding is not easy. It is interesting and often fun (especially as you get more experienced in it), but it is rarely easy. You'll often run into difficulties that you need to work through and solve more or less on your own. So while we'd like to say that "anyone can learn to code", it is more accurate to say that "anyone who is willing to work hard and persist through difficulties can code."


#. Yes, there is homework, which consists of prep work, exercises, studios,
   and assignments.
#. Only the assignments count toward your final grade.
#. You do not have to do the ungraded homework, but you absolutely *SHOULD*.


Best Practices
---------------

Here are some bits of advice:

#. DO try every exercise, studio and practice problem.
#. Repeated practice helps master the basic syntax quirks for a given
   programming language.
#. DO experiment. Once your code correctly solves the given task, feel
   free to tweak it. Great fun can be had if you ask, "What if I try ____,"
   and then go and do just that. For example, if a problem asks you to
   sort a list alphabetically, can you order it from z to a instead?
#. ASK FOR HELP when you get stuck. We've all been there, and there is
   no shame in seeking advice. Use your instructors, TAs, classmates,
   Stack Overflow, and Google as the brilliant resources they are.
#. The only "dumb questions" are the ones that are not asked.
#. The rubber duck method works. Sometimes just describing a coding
   problem out loud (to your screen, a co-worker, the wall, or a rubber
   duck) sparks an idea about how to solve it.
#. DO NOT copy/paste answers. There are plenty of websites where you
   can find complete code posted. A simple copy/paste into the assignment
   box will give you a correct result, but you have completely skipped
   your learning opportunity.
