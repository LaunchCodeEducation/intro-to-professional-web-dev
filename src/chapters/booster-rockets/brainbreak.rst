Step Away From Your Code
----------------------------

Sometimes you just need to take a break.  When you find yourself getting frustrated 
it's time to do something else for a bit and come back with fresh eyes.

Exercise, go for a walk, do the dishes, put on some music and dance, meditate, set a timer and look up memes(bonus share them with your peers).  
Does not matter what you do. By giving your brain a break, often times 
when you come back to the code you'll have new insight to the problem that had frustrated you in the first place.
