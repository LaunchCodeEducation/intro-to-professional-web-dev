Step Away From Your Computer
----------------------------

Sometimes you just need to take a break.  When you find yourself getting frustrated 
it's time to do something else for a bit and come back with fresh eyes.

Exercise, go for a walk, do the dishes, put on some music and dance, sing or both, 
yoga, meditation, set a timer and look up memes(bonus share them with your peers) 
watch a ted talk
