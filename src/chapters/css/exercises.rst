Exercises: CSS
==============

We have built a website for you to test your CSS knowledge. Check out the `repl.it <https://repl.it/@launchcode/CSSExercises/>`_!

For the exercises, add the following style rules to ``style.css``:

#. Change the background color to yellow.
#. Change all paragraph text color to green.
#. Change all ``h1`` to 36 px font size.
#. Align all text to the center of the page.
#. Let's say that you don't like aligning all of the text to the center. Use a CSS class to align only the headings to the center of the page.
#. Change the font color of elements with the id, ``cool-text``, to blue. 
#. Use a CSS id to change the elements in the ordered list to a color of your choosing.
