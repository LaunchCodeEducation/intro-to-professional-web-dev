Components
===========

.. index:: ! angular-component

In Angular a **component** controls one part of the page, called a *view*.

Angular builds a web page by combining multiple components together.
Splitting our page into individual components makes our application more
organized. It also increases our ability to focus on one section of our web
application at a time.

Everything in Angular centers on the idea of building a webpage from separate,
smaller pieces. We must understand how to get these pieces to work together,
and that begins by exploring what makes up each individual component. In order
to build a reliable component, we must understand how each of its parts work
and interact.

Start Fresh
------------

In the terminal, navigate back to the ``angular_practice`` folder you created
on the :ref:`Angular First Steps <angular-first-steps>` page. Create a new
project called ``component-practice``.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ ng new component-practice

Open the ``app.component.html`` file in VSCode. Remove ALL of the code and
replace it with an empty ``div`` element.

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <div>

   </div>

OK, the stage is set for a closer look at components.

Component Files
---------------

Angular components consist of 4 files:

#. an HTML file (.html)
#. a CSS file (.css)
#. a typescript file (.ts)
#. a test file (.spec.ts)

.. figure:: ./figures/ComponentPieces.png
   :alt: Visual of the files associated with a component.

Looking at the file tree, we see that all four files contain the name of the
component---``header``, in this case. Also, the files are located in a folder
named after the component.

If we add a new component named ``task-list``, the four files created inside
the ``task-list`` folder would be called:

#. ``task-list.component.html``
#. ``task-list.component.css``
#. ``task-list.component.ts``
#. ``task-list.component.spec.ts``

Each file contains information specific to that component.
``task-list.component.html`` holds the HTML required for the task-list and no
other component. ``task-list.component.css`` only styles html within the
``task-list`` folder, the typescript code in ``task-list.component.ts`` only
applies to this component, and all the tests for ``task-list`` will be found
in ``task-list.component.spec.ts``.

.. _add-new-component:

Adding a New Component
----------------------

Each component is a smaller part of an overall web application. The main
component, ``app``, serves as a base structure, and it comes standard with all
Angular applications. It is the container that holds all of the other
components, and it organizes them into the web application.

When you generate a new component using the Angular CLI, it is automatically
added to ``app``. Let's explore how this process works.

``ng generate``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a new Angular component, the terminal syntax is:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ ng generate component component-name

.. admonition:: Warning

   A common mistake is to create a new component in the wrong location, say in
   the ``src`` folder instead of in ``app``.

   ``ng generate`` places the new component folder within your current
   directory. Use the terminal to navigate to where you want the component to
   go BEFORE running the generate command.

Creating a ``task-list`` component looks something like this:

.. figure:: ./figures/GenerateComponent.png
   :alt: Visual of the terminal command to create a new Component.

From the output, we see that the ``ng generate`` command created four new files
in the ``src/app/task-list`` folder.

.. note::

   Recall that ``ng generate`` can be shortened to ``ng g``.

Try It
^^^^^^^

#. Use the terminal panel in VSCode to navigate into the ``app`` folder.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ ls
         first-project  component-practice
      $ cd component-practice
      $ cd src
      $ cd app
      $ ls
         app.component.css    app.component.spec.ts   app.module.ts
         app.component.html   app.component.ts

#. Run ``ng generate component task-list``.
#. Add a ``header`` component by running ``ng generate component header``.

When done, your file structure in VSCode should look something like:

.. figure:: ./figures/GenerateComponentResult.png
   :alt: Visual of the results of generate Component.

``app.module.ts``
------------------

In order to communicate with the new components, ``app.module.ts`` needs new
``import`` statements. Fortunately, ``ng generate`` updates the code
automatically. We do not need to worry about taking care of this task
ourselves.

Before ``ng generate``:

.. sourcecode:: typescript
   :linenos:

   import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

   import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

   @NgModule({
      declarations: [ AppComponent ],
      imports: [ BrowserModule ],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
   })
   export class AppModule { }

After generating the ``header`` and ``task-list`` components:

.. sourcecode:: typescript
   :linenos:

   import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

   import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
   import { TaskListComponent } from './task-list/task-list.component';
   import { HeaderComponent } from './header/header.component';

   @NgModule({
      declarations: [
         AppComponent,
         TaskListComponent,
         HeaderComponent
      ],
      imports: [ BrowserModule ],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
   })
   export class AppModule { }

Angular updates ``app.module.ts`` by adding new ``import`` statements on lines
5 and 6 as well as expanding the ``declarations`` array on line 9.

.. admonition:: Note

   Generating new components automatically updates ``app.module.ts``. However,
   if you *delete* a component, you must MANUALLY remove its ``import``
   statement and its name in the ``declarations`` array.

Arranging Components
---------------------

Run ``ng serve`` to launch the webpage. The page shows up empty because we
removed all of the code from ``app.component.html`` except for the ``div``
tags.

Modify ``app.component.html`` as follows:

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <div>
      <app-header></app-header>
   </div>

Save your change and wait for the webpage to refresh. You should now see the
text "header works!" at the top of the page.

.. figure:: ./figures/header-works.png
   :alt: Confirmation that the header component works.

This is another helpful feature with Angular---when you correctly implement a
new component, confirmation text appears on the screen.

How did ``<app-header></app-header>`` make this happen? Open
``header.component.ts`` in VSCode:

.. sourcecode:: typescript
   :linenos:

   import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
      selector: 'app-header',
      templateUrl: './header.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
   })
   export class HeaderComponent implements OnInit {

      constructor() { }

      ngOnInit() {
      }
   }

Line 4 defines the HTML tag for the ``header`` component to be ``app-header``.
If we try changing the string to ``'orange'``, we would see the "header
works!" text disappear from the webpage. This is because the HTML tag
``<app-header>`` is no longer linked to the component. The string assigned in
line 4 MUST match the tags used in ``app.component.html``.

Modify the Header Text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open ``header.component.html`` in VSCode:

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <p>header works!</p>

Ah ha! The HTML file contains the text that appeared on our webpage. Anything
added to this file will appear between the ``<app-header></app-header>`` tags
in ``app.component.html``.

.. admonition:: Try It

   #. Replace line 1 in ``header.component.html`` with:

      .. sourcecode:: html
         :linenos:

         <h1>My header works!</h1>
         <p>This is not a header, but I'm adding it anyway.</p>
         <div style="text-align: center">
            <h2>Look! A centered h2.</h2>
            <p>More centered text.</p>
         </div>
         <p>Not centered text.</p>

      Save your code and refresh the page. How does its appearance change?

   #. What happens if we use TWO ``<app-header>`` elements in ``app.component.html``?
      Try it to find out.

      .. sourcecode:: html
         :linenos:

         <div>
            <app-header></app-header>
            <app-header></app-header>
         </div>

Bring in ``task-list``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Line 4 in ``header.component.ts`` defined the ``app-header`` tag, and line 4 in
``task-list.component.ts`` does something similar.

Modify ``app.component.html`` as follows:

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <div>
      <app-header></app-header>
      <app-task-list></app-task-list>
   </div>

Your webpage should look similar to:

.. figure:: ./figures/header-and-task-list.png
   :alt: Two components added to the app template.

.. admonition:: Try It

   Move ``<app-task-list></app-task-list>`` above ``<app-header></app-header>``
   and see how the webpage changes.

THIS IS WHY TEMPLATES ARE AWESOME!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trying to correctly format and place content on a webpage can be difficult,
especially if you need to present lots of data or mix different formatting
styles for headings, lists, plain text, etc.

Rather than deal with our header, task-list, and other content at the same
time, creating components allows us to:

#. Create a simple HTML file that serves as a framework.
#. Format each piece of our content separately, without worrying about how that
   formatting affects other parts of the webpage.
#. Easily add content to the framework by using custom HTML tags.
#. Quickly relocate the components on a page just by rearranging their custom
   tags.

Component Nesting
-----------------

Components can be put inside of other components. In essence, this is how the
``app`` component works. It is the component that holds all other components.

However, sometimes you might want to nest a new component inside of another one
rather than in ``app``.

Let's assume we want to add a new component within our ``task-list`` folder. In
this case, we navigate into the ``task-list`` directory and then run the
``ng generate component`` command.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ ls
      app.component.css    app.component.spec.ts   app.module.ts   task-list
      app.component.html   app.component.ts        header
   $ cd task-list
   $ ng generate component inside-task-list

Running this command nests our new folder inside of the ``task-list`` folder,
and it contains the four files we would expect.

.. figure:: ./figures/GenerateNestedComponentResult.png
   :alt: Visual of the result of the running the commands to create a nested component.

When we place one component inside of another, we must pay attention to how the
components interact. The nested component is called the *child*, while the
original component is called the *parent*. In our example, ``task-list`` serves
as the parent, while ``inside-task-list`` is the child.

#. Any CSS, HTML, or JavaScript we write for the nested component (the child)
   only affects that component. Changes to the child do NOT affect the parent.
#. The parent component DOES influence the nested one. For example, any CSS
   within ``task-list.component.css`` applies to both
   ``task-list.component.html`` AND ``inside-task-list.component.html``.
#. If we want ``inside-task-list`` to have different styling, we need to add
   code to ``inside-task-list.component.css`` to override the parent.

Check Your Understanding
-------------------------

If you have not already done so, use  ``ng generate`` to *nest* the
``inside-task-list`` component inside the ``task-list component``.

.. admonition:: Question

   EXPERIMENT! Discover.

   Where could we place the ``<inside-task-list></inside-task-list>`` element to
   make "inside-task-list works!" appear on the screen? Select ALL options that
   work.

   #. Place the element in``app.component.html``.
   #. Place the element in ``task-list.component.html``.
   #. Place the element in ``inside-task-list.component.html``.
   #. Place the element in ``index.html``.
