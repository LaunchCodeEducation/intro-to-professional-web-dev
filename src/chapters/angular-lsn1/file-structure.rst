Angular File Structure
=======================

Each Angular project contains a standard file structure, which is shown in the
figure below.

.. figure:: ./figures/AngularFileStructure.png
   :alt: Visual of the standard Angular file structure.

All of the project files (and there will be LOTS) are stored in the single,
top-level folder, ``project-name``, which contains a ``src`` folder and a set
of support files.

.. admonition:: Note

   When you start a new Angular project, do not worry about the support files.
   These will be generated automatically, and they take care of the routine
   technical details for making your project run smoothly.

``src`` contains the ``app`` folder and five important files: ``index.html``,
``main.ts``, ``style.css``, ``tests.ts`` and ``polyfills.ts``. We will explore
these files in more detail on the next page. For now, recognize that they
control how the Angular project operates.

The ``app`` folder contains the files and subfolders needed to control the
nitty-gritty details of displaying a webpage. For your projects, most of your
time and effort will be spent modifying the contents within ``app``.

Installing Angular
-------------------

Angular uses its own set of command line instructions to create, update, and
launch projects. Before you dive too deeply into the Angular lessons, you need
to install the Angular command line interface (CLI) on your computer.
Fortunately, the process is relatively painless.

Open up the terminal (or the terminal panel in VSCode) and enter the following
command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   npm install -g @angular/cli@12

.. admonition:: Note

   There are more recent versions of this package but we're using version 12 for generating new code.
   When you pull down starter code from Github, you will have to run ``npm install`` which will set up that project to use Angular 8.
   While you may notice differences between the two versions, the core functionality of Angular will remain the same.
   
.. admonition:: Note

   If the installer prompts you to make choices, just accept all of the default
   options.

This command installs the CLI *globally* on your computer, which means that
Angular commands will work regardless of the folder you have open.

Angular commands begin with the keyword ``ng`` (for A-ng-ular), and the most
commonly used include:

#. ``ng new``: Creates a new Angular project in the current directory. The
   shortcut syntax is ``ng n``.
#. ``ng generate``: Creates new files within an existing project. The shortcut
   syntax is ``ng g``.
#. ``ng serve``: Compiles a project and *launches* it in a form that can be
   displayed in a browser. The shortcut syntax is ``ng s``.

For a complete list of commands, refer to the
`Angular documentation <https://angular.io/cli#command-overview>`__.

Check Your GitHub Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the "HTML Me Something" assignment, you created an account on
`GitHub <https://github.com>`__ . Since you will modify Angular projects
over several lessons, you need access to GitHub to download starter code and
store your progress.

Follow the link and make sure you remember your login information, or enroll
if you have not yet created an account.

What's in a Name?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you Google "Angular tutorial", you will receive plenty of hits. Some of the
resources will be exceptional, others not. However, you will probably notice
that many of the results refer to *AngularJS*. This is a previous version of
the software, and it is NOT the same as modern Angular.

AngularJS is NOT the same as Angular. Even the websites are different
(angularjs.org vs. angular.io). We recommend that you avoid AngularJS resources
for now. You can always learn how to use the old version later if your job
requires it.

Ready To Go
------------

As with any new coding skill or tool, the best way to learn is to actively
practice. Let's begin building your first Angular project.
