Using This Book
===============

Throughout this book, you will find a variety of different sections and
practice exercises. We are writing this guide to help you make the most of the
book.

Concept checks
--------------

Many sections end with a "Check Your Understanding". This section is full of
questions for you to double check that you understand the concepts in the
reading. Although your score does not count towards your final grade in the
class, you should use it to help evaluate your understanding of the main
concepts.

Examples
--------

Examples are times when we tie a concept we have just learned to a potential
real world application.

The label "Try It" signals an example that includes code you can modify and
augment to quickly reinforce what you have just read. Play around with these!

.. index:: ! repl.it

Repl.it
^^^^^^^

Many examples have links to **Repl.it**. This website allows you to write and
run practice code. Repl.it accounts are free, so we encourage you to
`sign up for one <https://repl.it/signup>`__. More details for using Repl.it
will be provided when you :ref:`write your first program <hello-world>`.

As you explore the prepared examples in this book, feel free to make changes to
the code. If you want to save your edits, click the *Fork* button at the top of
the workspace, and Repl.it will store a copy of the code in your personal
account.

Supplemental Content
--------------------

Occasionally, you will find a link to "Booster Rocket".
While not required reading, "Booster Rockets" can boost your learning.

JavaScript in Context
---------------------

Our approach is different from other ways you can learn JavaScript.
The book focuses on programming fundamentals.
These fundamentals are problem-solving and transferable concepts.
While we will cover the exact way to perform certain tasks in JavaScript, we
want to remind you that these tasks are relatively common and many programming
languages have ways to carry them out.
