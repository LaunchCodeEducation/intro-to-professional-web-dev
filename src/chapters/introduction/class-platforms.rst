Class Platforms
===============

Besides this book, this class uses additional platforms for enrollment,
assignments, and grading.

.. index:: ! Canvas

Canvas
------

LaunchCode monitors your progress in this class through a management system
called **Canvas**. It provides a central location to manage the flow of
information, but it does not hold the actual course content. Instead, it links
to the lessons you need, and it keeps a record of your completed assignments
and scores.

Login to Canvas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Access Canvas and the course materials at `<https://launchcode.instructure.com/>`__.
To login, use your launchcode.org username and password, which are the same
ones you used to apply for this class.

.. index:: ! Canvas dashboard

Canvas Dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After logging in, you will arrive at your **dashboard**. Your Canvas dashboard displays the
LaunchCode courses you can access, upcoming due dates, and several menu items.

Clicking on a course title takes you to that class' homepage. This page shows
upcoming due dates, announcements, general information, and menu options. You
will probably use the *Syllabus* and *Assignments* options the most often.

Syllabus Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The syllabus page provides general information, such as a description of the
class, the timeline for the course, a calendar, and a todo list. Scrolling
down on the page shows the *Course Summary*, which holds links to individual
tasks (reading, quizzes, assignments, etc.).

This page is a good place to answer the questions "What do I need to do next?"
and "How can I quickly find and review an old topic?".

Assignments Page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page sorts required tasks by date or type. We regularly add new tasks 
to this list so check back here often. Old content remains active,
allowing you to use the links for reference and review.

.. figure:: figures/course-assignments-page.png

Clicking on a specific title brings up information about that task, including
the due date, points possible, instructions, and links.

Even though much of the course content can be accessed without logging in, the
best choice is to begin your course work from within Canvas. That way your progress gets
recorded and your scores will update smoothly as you complete quizzes. Also,
submitting files for the larger assignments should only be done through Canvas.

.. index:: ! Repl.it

Repl.it
-------

`Repl.it <https://repl.it>`__ is a free online code editor, and it provides a
practice space to boost your programming skills.

For this class, Repl.it provides opportunities to respond to prompts, questions, "Try It" 
exercises, and studios embedded within the reading. 
These tasks are neither tracked nor scored.

Repl.it Account Creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Creating a Repl.it account is covered in
:ref:`Chapter 2 <create-replit-account>`. You'll need to create an account to use Repl.it.


Online Code Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Repl.it is an online code editor for various languages. Coders
collaborate by sharing Repl.it URLs.

Repl.it is used for:

#. Publicly sharing code examples and starter code
#. A place to practice new concepts by writing and running code

.. admonition:: Tip

   You never have to click save when using Repl.it. Repl.it automatically 
	saves your code on their servers.


.. _github-classroom:

.. index:: version control

GitHub Classroom
----------------

GitHub Classroom provides online code storage. For this class, it also
allows for graded assignment submission and evaluation.

GitHub is a web application that uses *version control*. We'll learn more about 
GitHub and what version control is in a future lesson.

.. admonition:: Note

   Results from work submitted in GitHub classroom, appear in Canvas after
   being verified.

   Remember, Canvas holds student grades and quizzes but NOT the course content.
   Instead, it provides *links* to the reading and other assignments.
