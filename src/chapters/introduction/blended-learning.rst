Blended Learning
================

This page covers what to expect during in-class time for students enrolled in a LaunchCode 
blended learning course. Students taking an independent learning course may skip this page.

We only have a short amount of time in class to learn a lot, so using a
**blended learning model** helps us make the most of our time in this course. A
blended learning model incorporates in-class learning with online materials
like this textbook.

In-Class Time
-------------

In class, you join fellow students on the same learning journey as
you. We encourage students to engage, interact, and encourage each other
throughout the class.

In-class time is run by an instructor and teaching assistants. This
dedicated staff facilitates the activities and provides support to the
students.

Large Group Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the large group time, the whole class participates in the lesson, led by
the instructor. The lesson is not a substitute for doing the prep work before
class. It's a time for us to review examples as a group and shore up concepts
from the reading.

Small Group Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the large group time, we break up into small groups, each led by a
teaching assistant. During small group time, we do in-class coding
activities called studios. This is a time to ask for individual support if you 
need it. It is meant to be a place where you can feel
comfortable talking openly about concepts you are struggling with.
