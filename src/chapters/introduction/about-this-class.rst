Course Activities

We have created the course activities to make the most of
your time. It is important to actively engage with each
activity to maximize your learning potential. Skipping the textbook reading or 
falling behind on assignments can quickly lead to struggling to complete the course.

Textbook Reading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Think of this textbook as your first destination in your learning journey. In addition to
reading, this text includes small questions that can help you reinforce your understanding 
of the new material. Reviewing your notes from a given chapter before moving on to the next 
is another great way to make the most of your learning potential.

Exercises
^^^^^^^^^

At the end of most of the textbook chapters, you will find a a page of *Exercises*.
These are small coding problems and are a chance for you to implement what
you have just learned. While exercises do not count towards your final grade in
the class, it is essential to practice in order to reinforce your understanding
of the new concepts.


Graded Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graded assignments are larger projects where you demonstrate what you have learned and
challenge yourself. Assignments oftentimes cover multiple lessons.
