Exercises: Strings
==================

Part One
--------

#. The ``length`` method returns how many characters are in a string. However,
   the method will NOT give us the length of a number. If ``num = 1001``,
   ``num.length`` returns ``undefined`` rather than 4.

   #. Use type conversion to print the length (number of digits) of an integer.
   #. Print the number of digits in a DECIMAL value (e.g. ``num = 123.45`` has 5
      digits but a length of 6).
      
      #. Modify your code to print out the length of a decimal value EXCLUDING the period.

   #. What if ``num`` could be EITHER an integer or a decimal?  Add an ``if/else``
      statement so your code can handle both cases.  (Hint: Consider the
      ``indexOf()`` or ``includes()`` string methods).

Part Two
--------

#. Remember, strings are *immutable*. Consider a string that represents a
   strand of DNA: ``dna = " TCG-TAC-gaC-TAC-CGT-CAG-ACT-TAa-CcA-GTC-cAt-AGA-GCT    "``.
   There are some typos in the string that we would like to fix:

   #. Use the ``trim()`` method to remove the leading and trailing whitespace,
      and then print the results.
   #. Change all of the letters in the dna string to UPPERCASE and print the
      result.
   #. Note that if you try ``console.log(dna)`` after applying the methods, the
      original, flawed string is displayed. To fix this, you need to
      *reassign* the changes back to ``dna``. Apply these fixes to your
      code so that ``console.log(dna)`` prints the DNA strand in UPPERCASE
      with no whitespace.

#. Let's use string methods to do more work on the DNA strand:

   #. Replace the sequence ``'GCT'`` with ``'AGG'``, and then print the altered
      strand.
   #. Look for the sequence ``'CAT'`` with ``indexOf()``. If found print, ``'CAT
      found'``, otherwise print, ``'CAT NOT found'``.
   #. Use ``slice()`` to print out the fifth set of 3 characters (called a **codon**)
      from the DNA strand.
   #. Use a template literal to print, ``"The DNA strand is ___ characters long."``
   #. Just for fun, apply methods to ``dna`` and use another template literal to
      print, ``'taco cat'``.

Part Three
----------

#. If we want to turn the string ``'JavaScript'`` into ``'JS'``, we might try
   ``.remove()``. Unfortunately, there is no such method in JavaScript.
   However, we can use our cleverness to achieve the same result.

   #. Use string concatenation and two ``slice()`` methods to print ``'JS'`` from
      ``'JavaScript'``.
   #. Without using ``slice()``, use method chaining to accomplish the same
      thing.
   #. Use bracket notation and a template literal to print, ``"The abbreviation for
      'JavaScript' is 'JS'."``
   #. Just for fun, try chaining 3 or more methods together, and then print the
      result.

#. Some programming languages (like Python) include a ``title()`` method to
   return a string with Every Word Capitalized (e.g. ``'title case'.title()``
   returns ``Title Case``).  JavaScript has no ``title()`` method, but that
   won't stop us! Use the string methods you know to print ``'Title Case'``
   from the string ``'title case'``.
