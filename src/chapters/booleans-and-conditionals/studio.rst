Studio: Goal Setting and Getting into the Right Mindset
=======================================================

.. index:: ! growth mindset

During this studio, we will ask you to think about your mindset when it comes to facing challenges.
Do challenges deter you or delight you?
If challenges are something you delight in, you might have a growth mindset.

A **growth mindset** can be powered by one word, “yet”.
The word “yet” allows us to acknowledge that we don’t know something AND that we are capable of learning it.
With “yet”, the sentence “I don’t understand booleans” becomes “I don’t understand booleans `yet`.”

Growth must occur over an entire career.
As technology evolves, even the most senior developers have to learn new skills.
Creating a framework for learning, which includes setting achievable goals, is important for being a developer.
Technology will change and adapt, and we should learn to do the same!

When setting goals, those goals should be SMART. SMART stands for:

	**Specific**

	**Measurable**

	**Attainable**

	**Relevant**

	**Time Bound**

We will be discussing your goals for this class and your career.
While you don't have to do any prior goal setting or preparation to make the most of this activity, please take the time to write down some goals before class if it would make you more comfortable.

.. note::

   If you have a place where you like to write down your goals and inspiration, such as a journal, feel free to bring it to class!
