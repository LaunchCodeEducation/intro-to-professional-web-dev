What is Git?
============

Version Control Systems
-----------------------

A version control system (VCS) is a system for tracking changes to a code base and storing each version.
Version control systems assist programmers with keeping backups and a history of the revisions made to the code base over time.
With that history, programmers can roll back to a version without a particular bug.
A VCS also enables collaboration between programmers as they can work on different versions of a code base and share their work. 

Git is one VCS and is prevalent amongst programmers and corporations.

.. index:: ! repository, ! commit

A VCS has a **repository** or storage container for the code base.
Repositories include the files within the code base, the versions over time and a log of the changes made.
When a programmer updates the repository, it means they are making a **commit**.

Getting Started with Git
------------------------

In order to get started with Git, you need to install :ref:`Git <git-install>` on your machine and :ref:`install Visual Studio Code <vsc-install>`.
