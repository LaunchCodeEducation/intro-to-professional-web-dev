Wrap-up
========

In this chapter, we showed how to use ``require`` to pull a module into your
project, and we presented two ways to use ``module.exports``. Of course, these
are not the only ways to share content.

A quick search online shows that besides functions, we can also share
individual variables. There are also alternative syntaxes for
``module.exports`` - even one that exports as an object, but imports as a
function (which means no dot notation). :-O

The skills you practiced here provide a solid foundation for modules. Learning
the alternatives becomes a matter of personal preference and the requirements
for your job.
