Why Use JavaScript Libraries
=============================

We use libraries to make our lives as developers easier. We can focus on
solving our specific problems if we don't have to spend time figuring out how
information flows throughout our project.

When it comes to web based applications, there are two very different places
code can exist: in the user's browser (front end) and on the host's server
(back end).

For web app development, consider the front end as what the user interacts with
and sees, while the back end contains the logic and manipulations that the user
doesn't need to worry about. Similar to how an old mechanical clock works. The
front end would be the face with the 12 numbers and the two moving hands. The
user only needs the clock face to determine the time. The back end for the
clock would be the various cogs, wheels, and power source.

In this chapter we will use Angular as our front-end JavaScript framework.
Angular dictates how to structure our files, as well as how the information
flows between them. It also contains a number of tools to help us build the
part of the application users see in their web browsers.

.. admonition:: Note

   There are many other ways to create front-end web applications with JavaScript. Popular frameworks for JavaScript include React, Vue, Ember, and others.

Angular is a framework that breaks the overall project into smaller pieces,
each with their own code and styling. Angular then combines all of the pieces
to create the full web page.

Taking this modular based approach allows us to separate the individual pieces
of our application so we can focus on them one at a time.

Through the next three chapters we will look at the basic building blocks of an
Angular application.
