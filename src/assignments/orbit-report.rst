Assignment #6: Orbit Report
===========================

.. admonition:: Warning

   Please do not attempt this assignment until AFTER your first lesson on
   Angular. It can be tempting to dive right in, but Angular is a broad topic,
   and you want to wait to start until you have time to go over the
   requirements in class.

There are thousands of satellites orbiting the earth. You are tasked with
creating a searchable, sortable table of satellites. For the purposes of this
assignment, a **satellite** will be defined as any object purposefully placed
into orbit.

Your table will have the following features:

#. **Satellites**: Each row in the table contains data on one satellite.
#. **Search form:** Filters the results based on matches to the entered text.
   Pressing enter or clicking the button triggers the search.
#. **Sortable columns:** The ``Name`` and ``Type`` column headers can be
   clicked, which will sort the table using that property.
#. **Counts:** Displays the total number of satellites in the table, as well as
   the count for each type of satellite.

Your completed assignment should look something like this:

.. figure:: figures/orbit-report-table.png
   :alt: Screenshot of orbit report table.

You can also view gifs of the finished project in the
:ref:`Orbit Report Demo <orbit-report-demo>` section at the bottom of this
page.

Setup
------

#. Use ``ng new`` to create a new Angular project named ``orbit-report``.
   Prompt answers: No Routing, Use CSS.
#. Create a new repository in your GitHub account named ``orbit-report``. Copy
   the URL for this empty repo.
#. In the terminal, navigate into your local ``orbit-report`` directory and
   link the Angular project to the GitHub repo:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      $ git remote add origin <remote-url>

#. Finally, commit and push your Angular assignment to GitHub.

Requirements
-------------

As you accomplish each task, be sure to commit and push your changes before
moving on to the next item.

1) Define and Create Satellites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular projects, you can create classes to
represent entities in the project. For this project you need to create a class
named ``Satellite`` to represent, you guessed it, a satellite. The
``Satellite`` class needs to define the properties needed to accurately
represent a satellite.

#. In terminal go to the ``orbit-report`` folder.
#. Create a class with command ``$ ng generate class Satellite``.
#. Notice that the new file ``orbit-report/src/app/satellite.ts`` was created.
#. Add these properties to the ``Satellite`` class in ``satellite.ts``:

   .. sourcecode:: js

      name: string;
      orbitType: string;
      type: string;
      operational: boolean;
      launchDate: string;

#. Add a constructor to ``Satellite`` class.

   a. Constructor signature should be:

      .. sourcecode:: TypeScript

         constructor(name: string, type: string, launchDate: string, orbitType: string, operational: boolean)

   b. You need to assign the class properties in the constructor.

Now we need to use the ``Satellite`` class to create an initial array of
``Satellite`` objects.

6. Define an array named ``sourceList`` in ``app.component.ts``.

   a. ``sourceList: Satellite[];``
   b. For this to compile, you must add ``import { Satellite } from
      './satellite';`` to the top of the file.

#. In the ``constructor`` in ``app.component.ts`` set ``sourceList`` to be an
   array of ``Satellite`` objects.

   .. sourcecode:: typescript

      constructor() {
         this.sourceList = [
            new Satellite("SiriusXM", "Communication", "2009-03-21", "LOW", true),
            new Satellite("Cat Scanner", "Imaging", "2012-01-05", "LOW", true),
            new Satellite("Weber Grill", "Space Debris", "1996-03-25", "HIGH", false),
            new Satellite("GPS 938", "Positioning", "2001-11-01", "HIGH", true),
            new Satellite("ISS", "Space Station", "1998-11-20", "LOW", true),
         ];
      }

#. In the terminal run ``ng serve``.
#. View the app in your browser. At this point you should see the default
   Angular starter page. If you don't, check the build output and browser
   console for any errors.

2) Create Orbit List Component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you have an array of ``Satellite`` objects, you need to display them.
To do that, create a new component named ``orbit-list``.

#. Generate the ``orbit-list`` component in the ``app`` folder. If you need a
   reminder of how to do this, review the
   :ref:`Adding a New Component <add-new-component>` section.
#. Replace the contents of ``app.component.html`` with just one line of code,
   ``<app-orbit-list></app-orbit-list>``.
#. View the app in your browser. You should see: ``orbit-list works!``

3) Pass in Satellites to Orbit List Component
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``orbit-list`` component's job is to show a list of satellites. Remember,
you declared an array of ``Satellite`` objects in ``app.component.ts`` named
``sourceList``. In order to pass that array into the ``orbit-list``, you need
to learn a new Angular feature named `input properties <https://angular.io/guide/component-interaction#pass-data-from-parent-to-child-with-input-binding>`__.
Here, the term "input" refers to data being sent *into* the component. Angular
input properties are NOT related to HTML ``input`` elements.

Currently, ``app.component.html`` uses the ``orbit-list`` component like so:

.. sourcecode:: html+ng2

   <app-orbit-list></app-orbit-list>

To pass the ``sourceList`` array into the ``orbit-list`` component, you need to
learn new syntax.

#. Modify ``<app-orbit-list></app-orbit-list>`` in ``app.component.html`` as
   follows:

   .. sourcecode:: html+ng2

      <app-orbit-list [satellites]="sourceList"></app-orbit-list>

   a. ``[satellites]`` declares a new ``satellites`` property on the
      ``orbit-list`` component.
   b. ``="sourceList"`` sets the value of the ``satellites`` property to be the
      ``sourceList`` array.

#. View the app in your browser. You should NOT see the message ``orbit-list
   worked!`` Why?
#. Open developer tools in your browser and look at the JavaScript console.

   You should see an error message telling you that the ``orbit-list``
   component does NOT have a ``satellites`` property. Note that only the
   relevant message text has been included below.

   ::

      Error: Template parse errors:
      Can't bind to 'satellites' since it isn't a known property of 'app-orbit-list'.
      1. If 'app-orbit-list' is an Angular component and it has 'satellites' input, then verify that it is part of this module.

To solve this issue, you need to declare in ``orbit-list.component.ts`` that
the component has an input property named ``satellites``.

4. Add the code below just before the constructor in
   ``orbit-list.component.ts``.

   .. sourcecode:: typescript

      @Input() satellites: Satellite[];

   The ``@Input()`` is special Angular syntax that declares that ``satellites``
   is a property that will be passed into the component via
   ``<app-orbit-list [satellites]="sourceList"></app-orbit-list>``.

#. Update the ``import`` statements in ``orbit-list.component.ts`` to access
   the ``Input`` and ``Satellite`` classes.

   .. sourcecode:: typescript
      :linenos:

      import { Component, OnInit, Input } from '@angular/core';
      import { Satellite } from '../satellite';

#. View the app in your browser. You should see ``orbit-list works!`` but no
   satellites yet. That is the next step.

4) Display Table of Satellites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that ``orbit-list`` has a ``satellites`` property that is an array of
``Satellite`` objects, you can use that array to build an HTML table with each
row being a different satellite.

#. In ``orbit-list.component.html`` use ``*ngFor`` to loop over the
   ``satellites`` array. The HTML table you build should look like the
   following.

   .. sourcecode:: html+ng2
      :linenos:

      <h3>Orbit Report</h3>
      <table>
         <tr class="header-row">
            <th class="sortable">Name</th>
            <th class="sortable">Type</th>
            <th>Operational</th>
            <th>Orbit Type</th>
            <th>Launch Date</th>
         </tr>
         <!-- TODO: put <tr *ngFor=""></tr> here -->
      </table>

Next, you need to include CSS that will make your table and application look a
little nicer.

2. Copy the entire contents of the example `orbit-list-component.css  <https://gist.github.com/welzie/5247f5ac36e973903cd5202af50932e6>`__
   and put it into your ``orbit-list-component.css``. Leave the ``sortable``
   class alone, but change the ``table`` and ``warning`` styles to colors
   and sizes you find pleasing.
#. Copy the entire contents of the example `app.component.css <https://gist.github.com/welzie/5247f5ac36e973903cd5202af50932e6>`_ and put it into your ``app.component.css``.
#. Copy the ``<style>`` tag from the example `index.html <https://gist.github.com/welzie/5247f5ac36e973903cd5202af50932e6>`_ and paste it into the ``<head>`` of your ``index.html``.

   a. Only add in the ``<style>``, do NOT remove any other HTML from your
      ``index.html``.

#. View the app in your browser. Your table should look something like:

   .. figure:: figures/basic-table-satellites.png
      :alt: Screen shot of browser showing http://localhost:4200 with a table of four satellites.

      Example of application at this point.

5) Fetch Satellite Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far, you have used an array declared in ``app.component.ts`` as the source
of data to display. Your next task is to switch to using a ``fetch`` that
retrieves json data from a server.

#. Replace your ``constructor`` in ``AppComponent`` with the code below.
#. Implement the three features mentioned in the ``TODO:`` comments.

   .. sourcecode:: typescript

      constructor() {
         this.sourceList = [];
         let satellitesUrl = 'https://handlers.education.launchcode.org/static/satellites.json';

         window.fetch(satellitesUrl).then(function(response) {
            response.json().then(function(data) {

               let fetchedSatellites = data.satellites;
               // TODO: loop over satellites
               // TODO: create a Satellite object using new Satellite(fetchedSatellites[i].name, fetchedSatellites[i].type, fetchedSatellites[i].launchDate, fetchedSatellites[i].orbitType, fetchedSatellites[i].operational);
               // TODO: add the new Satellite object to sourceList using: this.sourceList.push(satellite);

            }.bind(this));
         }.bind(this));

      }

.. admonition:: Note

   Explaining the ``.bind(this)`` syntax is beyond the scope of this book, but
   the statements are crucial for ``this.sourceList.push(satellite)`` to work
   properly.

3. View the app in your browser. Your table should look similar to:

   .. figure:: figures/fetched-table-satellites.png
      :alt: Screen shot of browser showing http://localhost:4200 with a table of 9 satellites.

      Example of application after switching to fetched data.

6) Highlight Space Debris
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to make it easier to spot dangerous space debris in the list. Add an
Angular attribute directive to accomplish this.

#. Add a ``shouldShowWarning`` method to the ``Satellite`` class.

   a. ``shouldShowWarning`` returns a boolean and has no parameters.
   b. ``shouldShowWarning`` returns ``true`` if the satellite ``type`` is
      ``'Space Debris'``, and it returns ``false`` otherwise. Note that this
      check should be case-insensitive.

#. Use ``shouldShowWarning`` to add the ``warning`` CSS class to the ``<td>``
   containing the satellite's type.

   a. For guidance refer to the section on :ref:`changing styles with attribute directives <changing-styles-with-booleans>`.

   .. figure:: figures/table-satellites-with-warning.png
      :alt: Screen shot of browser showing http://localhost:4200 with a table of 9 satellites, with Space Debris cell having a red background.

      Example of warning style adding a red background to Space Debris type.

.. admonition:: Note

   If you prefer, modify the table HTML to make the entire row the warning
   color.

7) Sorting
^^^^^^^^^^^

Sorting is a useful feature for any table. When a user clicks the "Name"
heading, sort the table by the ``name`` property. Also, if the user clicks the
"Type" heading, then sort the table by the ``type`` property.

#. Add an Angular click handler that calls ``sort('name')`` to the Name
   ``<th>`` element. Note that the sorting feature will NOT work until you
   have completed step 3.

#. Add an Angular click handler that calls ``sort('type')`` to the Type
   ``<th>`` element.
#. Add a ``sort`` method to the ``OrbitListComponent`` class. Remember that
   by convention, the method should come *after* the ``constructor`` *and*
   ``ngOnInit``.

   a. The sorting method has been provided below.
   b. To see an example of the sort working, see the
      :ref:`Orbit Report Demo <orbit-report-demo>` below.

   .. sourcecode:: typescript

      sort(column: string): void {
         // array.sort modifies the array, sorting the items based on the given compare function
         this.satellites.sort(function(a: Satellite, b: Satellite): number {
            if(a[column] < b[column]) {
               return -1;
            } else if (a[column] > b[column]) {
               return 1;
            }
            return 0;
         });
      }

.. admonition:: Note

   The provided ``sort`` method contains a new usage of the ``array.sort`` method. Previously in the book you used
   ``array.sort`` without passing it a function, see :ref:`sort function examples <sort-examples>`. This usage of ``array.sort``
   uses a compare function, which allows you to control how the objects in the array are sorted. A compare function
   is needed to sort the array of ``Satellite`` objects, because JavaScript does not know how to sort objects, JavaScript
   needs you to tell it which ``Satellite`` object should go before another ``Satellite`` object.
   For more details about the compare function see
   `MDN description of sort using a compare function <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#Description>`_.

8) Searching
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You are doing great! Next you will add a search feature.

#. Add this HTML ``<div class="search-form"></div>`` in ``app.component.html``.
#. Add an ``<input>`` element inside the ``<div>``.
#. Add a ``<button>`` element inside the ``<div>``.
#. Add an Angular ``(click)`` handler to the ``<button>`` that calls
   ``search(searchTerm.value)``. ``searchTerm`` is the local variable
   name for the ``<input>``.
#. Add an Angular ``(keyup.enter)`` handler to the ``<input>`` that also calls
   ``search(searchTerm.value)``.
#. Add a ``search`` method to the ``AppComponent`` class. The code for this
   method is provided below.

   .. sourcecode:: typescript
      :linenos:

      search(searchTerm: string): void {
         let matchingSatellites: Satellite[] = [];
         searchTerm = searchTerm.toLowerCase();
         for(let i=0; i < this.sourceList.length; i++) {
            let name = this.sourceList[i].name.toLowerCase();
            if (name.indexOf(searchTerm) >= 0) {
               matchingSatellites.push(this.sourceList[i]);
            }
         }
         // assign this.displayList to be the the array of matching satellites
         // this will cause Angular to re-make the table, but now only containing matches
         this.displayList = matchingSatellites;
      }

Notice the usage of a new variable named ``displayList``. ``displayList``
should contain the ``Satellite`` objects that the user wants to see.
Previously ALL the satellites were displayed, because there was not a search
feature. Now the user can perform a search, which means they want to see ONLY
the matching results. The ``sourceList`` variable contains ALL the
``Satellite`` objects. If you removed the ``Satellite`` objects from
``sourceList`` that didn't match the search term, then the user could never
see them again. Instead when the user performs a search, ``displayList`` will
be populated with only the matching ``Satellite`` objects in ``sourceList``.
Matching is defined as ``satellite.name`` containing the search term.

7. Add the ``displayList: Satellite[];`` property to the ``AppComponent``
   class and set ``displayList = []`` in the constructor.

#. Pass in the ``displayList`` to the ``orbit-list-component``.

   .. sourcecode:: html+ng2

      <app-orbit-list [satellites]="displayList"></app-orbit-list>

#. View the app in your browser. Why is the table empty when the app loads?
   What is the value of ``displayList`` when the app first loads?

#. Set ``displayList`` to be a copy of ``sourceList`` when the app loads.

   a. Add this code after ``sourceList`` has been populated by the fetched
      data in the ``constructor``.

      .. sourcecode:: typescript

               // make a copy of the sourceList to be shown to the user
               this.displayList = this.sourceList.slice(0);
            }.bind(this));
         }.bind(this));

#. For an example of search working, see
   :ref:`Orbit Report Demo <orbit-report-demo>`.

Bonus Missions
---------------

A) Zebra Stripes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternate the color for every other row in the table. Choose whichever pair
of colors you prefer, but the highlighting for space debris should still be
distinct.

.. figure:: figures/orbit-report-zebra.png
   :alt: Alternating row colors.

B) Counting Satellites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a new component that shows the total number of satellites currently
displayed in the table. Also, the component should show the number of each
type of satellite.

#. Create an ``orbit-counts`` component.
#. Add styles to ``orbit-counts.component.css`` to make your count table
   complement the list of satellites, or use the CSS provided in this
   `sample file  <https://gist.github.com/welzie/5247f5ac36e973903cd5202af50932e6>`__.
#. Add the ``orbit-counts`` component to ``app.component.html``.
#. Pass in ``displayList`` via ``[satellites]="displayList"``.
#. Use the given HTML as a template. Remember to replace the hard-coded counts.

   .. sourcecode:: html
      :linenos:

      <h3>Satellite Counts:</h3>
      <div class="counts">
         <div>Total: <span>9</span></div>
         <div>Space Debris: <span>1</span></div>
         <div>Communication: <span>2</span></div>
         <div>Probe: <span>2</span></div>
         <div>Positioning: <span>1</span></div>
         <div>Space Station: <span>2</span></div>
         <div>Telescope: <span>1</span></div>
      </div>

#. The rest of the steps are left for you to figure out! Your completed
   component should look similar to:

   .. figure:: figures/orbit-counts-output.png
      :alt: Example of six satellite counts being displayed.

      Example of the seven different satellite counts being displayed.

C) Update the Search Feature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modify the search feature to find matches using the ``orbitType`` and ``type``
properties.

If you completed the counting satellites bonus, use an ``*ngFor`` to loop over
an array of the different types, instead of explicitly writing a ``<tr>`` for
each satellite type.

.. admonition:: Note

   You may have already completed this mission, depending on how you
   accomplished counting the satellites.
