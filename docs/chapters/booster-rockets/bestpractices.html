<p id="best-practices">For years, the education community has debated the best approach for
<em>homework</em>. Should it be scored or not? What is the proper amount? Should
it be even be assigned? Many reports begin with &quot;Studies have shown…,&quot; but
no universally accepted conclusion has emerged.</p>
<p>We cannot possibly restate all the conclusions here, nor will we present any
part of the debates. Instead, here are a few simple facts for LC101:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Yes, there is homework, which consists of prep work, exercises, studios,
and assignments.</li>
<li>Only the assignments count toward your final grade.</li>
<li>You do not have to do the ungraded homework, but you absolutely <em>SHOULD</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this page is our attempt to motivate you to complete ALL of the
work for LC101. How much encouragement you need depends on your personality.
Read the sections that appeal to your psyche and are most likely to encourage
you.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<div>&quot;Thanks, LaunchCode, but you convinced me at, 'Do all the homework.' &quot;</div></blockquote>
<p>If this is your thinking, then bless you. Skip to the best practices listed
in the last section of this page. <em>You're awesome!</em></p>
<p>Otherwise, on to the motivation...</p>

<p>Experience is definitely the best teacher. You could read pages and pages
about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops, which will give you a handle on the vocabulary. However,
until you actually construct your first working loop, your understanding will
be incomplete.</p>

<p>Imagine you land a sweet tech job, and on your first day your boss says to you,
&quot;Implement a recursive algorithm to flatten our data structure.&quot; If your entire
prep for this job was reading with very little coding, you might understand
each individual word, but actually accomplishing the task would be a disaster.</p>
<p>Now imagine your prep involved using recursion and constructing algorithms over
and over again. You would not only understand the words, but also have a
strong idea of how to convert those words into working code.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote">
<div>&quot;If I stumble, I WILL pick myself up, brush off the dust, and try again.&quot;</div></blockquote>
<p>All throughout LC101, you will be asked to code. Each exercise, studio and
assignment is designed to give you experience through practice. You WILL make
mistakes, and that is OK. Often, our mistakes teach us more than getting the
correct answer on our first try.</p>
<p>Every genius programmer you see on Facebook or YouTube started out in front of
a screen saying, &quot;Oops,&quot; &quot;ARGH!&quot; or &quot;#*&amp;%%&#64;#!&quot; No one simply &quot;gets&quot; coding
without some trial-and-error.</p>

<h2>31.1.4. Effort = Outcome<a class="headerlink" href="#effort-outcome" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let's take a look at a sample coding task: <em>&quot;Prompt the user to enter a number, then print 'Even' if it is divisible by 2, otherwise print 'Odd'.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Now let's take a look at an imaginary student's attempt at solving this problem:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Hmmm. A blank answer space. What might be the reason?</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>The student did not understand how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The student knew how to solve the problem and decided to skip the task.</li>
<li>The student tried to solve the problem, could not get the program to work, so deleted the code.</li>
<li>The student ran out of time when trying to complete the prep work before class.</li>
</ol>
<p>From a teacher's perspective, ANY of these reasons could be valid, and we have
no way of determining which is true. This prevents us from knowing how to best
help the student. Where would we begin?</p>
<p>For the student, a blank response provides no benefit because the necessary
practice was either ignored or incomplete. Students gain only as much as they
put in. SO:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Even if you have no clue how to approach a task, MAKE AN ATTEMPT ANYWAY, then ask questions.</li>
<li>If you know how to solve the problem, COMPLETE THE TASK ANYWAY, because practice makes better. Also, you could use your code to help answer a classmate's question.</li>
<li>If you tried to solve the problem, but your code did not work, DO NOT DELETE YOUR ATTEMPT. Ask a question. Showing your work to your teacher, TA or classmates will give them a clear idea about your thought process.</li>
<li>If you ran out of time, GO BACK AND FILL IN THE BLANKS LATER. Practice makes better. If you neglect one set of skills, then the tasks that come later and depend on those skills will be more difficult.</li>

<h2>31.1.7. Marathon Analogy<a class="headerlink" href="#marathon-analogy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pretend you are not a runner (complete with the &quot;0.0&quot; sticker on your car),
but you decide to compete in a marathon. You cannot just drive to the
starting line, put on your running shoes and go.</p>
<p>You have to train:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Begin by getting good at running 1 mile.</li>
<li>Then get good at running 3 miles.</li>
<li>Then get good at running 6, then 8, then 10 miles. By now you could try a
half-marathon, and proudly slap a &quot;13.1&quot; sticker on your car.</li>
<li>Continue training and increasing your distance. You WILL earn that &quot;26.2&quot;
sticker, which will look GREAT when placed in line with 0.0 and 13.1.</li>
<li>Your stickers demonstrate your commitment and might even inspire other
non-runners. They will see how you started &quot;just like them&quot; and notice how
your effort spurred personal growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning to code follows the same idea:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Begin with &quot;Hello world!&quot;</li>
<li>Then learn variables, strings and arrays.</li>
<li>Then learn if/else statements and loops, followed by functions and modules.</li>
<li>Then code your first &quot;half-marathon&quot;.</li>
<li>Continue practicing to increase your skills. You WILL earn that
marathon.js sticker as you build solid demo projects and complete more
interviews.</li>
<li>Welcome, fellow coder. Don't forget to inspire others.</li>
</ol>

<h2>31.1.8. Best Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Whew!</em>  You made it to the bottom of the page. Good job. Here are some final bits of advice:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>DO try every exercise, studio and practice problem.</li>
<li>Repeated practice helps master the basic syntax quirks for a given
programming language.</li>
<li>DO experiment. Once your code correctly solves the given task, feel
free to tweak it. Great fun can be had if you ask, &quot;What if I try ____,&quot;
and then go and do just that. For example, if a problem asks you to
sort a list alphabetically, can you order it from z to a instead?</li>
<li>ASK FOR HELP when you get stuck. We've all been there, and there is
no shame in seeking advice. Use your instructors, TAs, classmates,
Stack Overflow, and Google as the brilliant resources they are.</li>
<li>The only &quot;dumb questions&quot; are the ones that are not asked.</li>
<li>The rubber duck method works. Sometimes just describing a coding
problem out loud (to your screen, a co-worker, the wall, or a rubber
duck) sparks an idea about how to solve it.</li>
<li>DO NOT copy/paste answers. There are plenty of websites where you
can find complete code posted. A simple copy/paste into the assignment
box will give you a correct result, but you have completely skipped
your learning opportunity.</li>
</ol>
<p>And don't forget:</p>
